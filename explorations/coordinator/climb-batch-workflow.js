// Workflow script: one batch of the compile-path ladder climb.
//
// What it does, stage by stage, and why: explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.md
// (the manual) and explorations/coordinator/process-engineering/batch-redesign.md (the
// practice it builds, with the evidence and the cost of each choice). A batch is a manifest
// change and nothing else: the coordinator splices the block between the MANIFEST and END
// MANIFEST lines from the batch's generator (explorations/compile-ladder/plan-<N>/manifest/)
// and launches. Before the launch the coordinator builds the batch's one base build; each
// rung worker makes its own worktree, seeded from it:
//   Workflow({scriptPath: 'explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.js',
//             args: {base: '<the full hash of the base>', baseBuild: '<the base build, a built worktree at that commit>'}})
//
// The shape since the redesign of 2026-10-08: each rung's worker does the rung test first;
// its skeptic checks it and fixes what it finds, test first; a judge rules only on a fix
// the skeptic marks contested or on a rung it cannot fix, and a repair round runs only on
// the judge's word; no second skeptic. Then the gather lands the approved rungs on main,
// the merged-diff review and the gate run side by side, and the commit stage lands the
// gate's tables, runs the microGPT walk check and pushes. The batch writes no skill text:
// each rung's revival-change material goes into the batch's RECORD.md, and the standing
// skill writer writes the skill from it after the landing, before a cold read
// (explorations/reviews/skills-agenda-audit.md, "Proposed fix to the mechanism"). Every
// agent is pinned to Opus but a judge's second ruling on the same rung or tree, which runs
// on Fable (POSITIONS.md, "The judge's rulings."). Every prompt
// points to the fortress-repo skill for how to build, test, run the old code, wait and
// commit, and says only what the role does in this batch. No backticks and no non-ASCII
// character anywhere in this file.
//
// Every agent() call goes through callAgent ("An agent that comes back with nothing"),
// which runs a role again, up to two more times, when its agent returns nothing; a usage
// or rate limit, or a rung worker, skeptic or judge that returns nothing after its
// attempts, stops the run there and decides nothing, and resumeFromRunId with the same
// script and args then runs that role again.

"**The mission.** Climb batch 29 built the field numerals (7daf51fe8a). The one library's NaturalNumeral and RadixPointNumeral are value objects with the four numbers as fields, getters, asFloat, asString and = pairs with the number types (Library/FortressLibrary.fsi:454-494); walk builds one at each site and calls the place type's coercion with it (interpreter/evaluator/values/Numerals.java); the compiled path still types a numeral by the prelude's IntLiteral and FloatLiteral, whose value carries no four numbers (rows 969, 970); the fold hands a program's coercion a negative constant with its sign (rows 961, 968). The decisions on record build the static numerals instead: a numeral's type exists only at compile time, the four numbers its static parameters; every number type, the library's too, takes a numeral through a coercion generic over them, which the compiler instantiates and folds and walk runs once per place; no numeral value exists at run time (P-174, P-176). An Opus probe built them on both paths in a worktree of the base and measured each step (explorations/compile-ladder/plan-30/probes/draft-numerals.md; its patch beside it, draft-numerals.patch). You start from that patch and build what it did not.",
"",
"**The decisions this rung builds.** P-174; P-176; P-173, where a numeral converts and the fold first; P-37's exception, the prelude carrying the static numerals until the switch-over; P-40, the bound for sizes, the four numbers ZZ as values; P-165, no asFloat on a numeral type; P-12, walk refusing when the place runs. The snapshot's sections 3, 4 and 11 give his words; where an entry and the snapshot differ, the snapshot rules. Section 3 of this record, forks A1 to A8, gives the defaults you build. The probe's question 1, u = 0 for a zero u: NN32, is the curator's and is not built: the patch's state lands, walk's answer pinned in tests/XXXNumeralEqualsNumberWalk.fss (section 3, Q1).",
"",
"**What you build, in order.**",
"1. **The probe's build, as your first commit.** From your worktree's root: git apply explorations/compile-ladder/plan-30/probes/draft-numerals.patch (it applies to the base's code with one whitespace warning, 90 paths: PROBES, probe 1), git add its new files, and commit it alone, titled as the static numerals probe's build, with its historical: line. Build it as the skill's build-and-caches.md gives for an edit of the library, the prelude, Java and Scala. The patch's tests were seen failing on the base by the probe (PROBE 7. Step 6: walk, 7 files, \"Tests run: 7, Failures: 7\"; compiled, 14 files, \"Tests run: 18, Failures: 17\"), and its suites and stages on that code are PROBE 8. The gate: they are your before and its measurements; cite them, and run nothing again on this commit but what step 2 onwards needs. Every later change to a file of the patch is yours, in a commit of its own, with its reason in REPORT.md.",
"2. **A numeral as written at a library type, through the type's own coercion, folded from its body** (fork A1). The site rule admits the library's types; foldsTo keeps only folded constants; the fold reads the declaring component's coercion and evaluates its body over fork A1's fragment; an int, long, float or double result is the place's constant, any other result or a stop takes step 3's call into a static final. Put the evaluator in a class of its own, in compiler/codegen/ or compiler/desugarer/. Tests first:",
"   - a unit test of the evaluator beside compiler/desugarer/NumeralFoldJUTest.java, run by ant testOnly -DtestPattern=<its class>: each of the prelude's numeral coercions (at ZZ, ZZ32, ZZ64, NN32, NN64, RR32 and RR64, the natural and the radix-point one where the type has both) evaluated at numerals that include each type's bounds, and at ZZ, RR32 and RR64 a numeral of more than 20 digits, to the constant that walk gives; a body with a constructor call, a do block or a native over a non-number type not folded. It fails first: the class does not exist.",
"   - fork A7's library tests, ProjectFortress/library_tests/NumeralFoldIntegers.fss and NumeralFoldFloats.fss with their .test files (link, run), asserting the values at each prelude type, compiled: 2147483647 at ZZ32, 4294967295 at NN32, 9223372036854775807 at ZZ64, 18446744073709551615 at NN64, a 30-digit numeral at ZZ, 0.1 at RR64 and at RR32 by their bits, 16777217 at RR32, 0.1_2 at RR64. They pass on the patch's commit, whose fold by the target type gives the same values: they are guards, and say so; walk's values of the same numerals are tests/NumeralTypesWalk.fss's.",
"3. **One method per numeral coercion** (fork A2). The lowering of each numeral coercion's declaration, the call at each place, a generic type's coercion keeping its type parameters; the probe's inlining removed. Tests first: an api and its component in ProjectFortress/compiler_tests/, in the form of ApiTraitOverloadApi.fsi and .fss, declaring a program's number type whose numeral coercion calls a function that its component does not export, and a test component that imports it and checks one object per place, two places two objects, and the value of a numeral of more than 20 digits; seen failing on the patch's commit, where the call stays at its place and the class loader instantiates the coercion per numeral (PROBE 10. What was not built). The patch's same-component tests (NumeralStaticDesignCompiled, NumeralCoercionOnceCompiled, NumeralCoercionGenericTypeCompiled) are the one form's guards.",
"4. **The minus with the coercion** (P-176; PROBE 10. What was not built, third bullet). At a program's type, the static final holds the type's own - applied to the coercion's result. Test first: compiled, a reference type whose coercion and whose - each print a word, one place of -3 evaluated twice: each word printed once, before the run starts, in the form of NumeralCoercionOnceCompiled.test's run_out_equals, and the two evaluations one object; seen failing on the patch's commit, where the - runs at each evaluation. Walk makes the whole constant once already (PROBE 6. Step 5): the same cases under walk are its guard.",
"5. **Folded constants at a library type, on both paths** (fork A3). Walk converts a folded constant at a library type from its exact value, outside the numeral coercion (interpreter/evaluator/values/Numerals.java and Coercions.java as the patch leaves them); the compiled half is the patch's. Its tests are guards under walk, passing before and after, and say so: -2147483648 at ZZ32, -3000000000 at ZZ64 and at RR64, -0.5 at RR32, -0.0 at RR64 with 1/r negative and infinite, 2 + 3 at ZZ64, -3 at ZZ, -0.1 at QQ as -1/10.",
"6. **The hierarchy** (fork A4). A compiled refusal test, its .test name carrying XXX as the tree's refusal tests do (PROBE 7. Step 6): object O extends NaturalNumeral[\\1, 10, 3\\] refused. If the patch's checker refuses it already, it is a guard; if not, the written-only rule reaches an extends clause, test first.",
"7. **The dead classes** (fork A8), each deleted only once ant compileAll passes without it, the rest in one new row.",
"8. **Row 957's second case, if it fits** (fork A5), test first: compiled, object Box[\\T\\] with m(): Gen[\\T\\] = 3, two calls on one instance's type one object, two instances' types two; seen failing on your tree before the change.",
"9. **The suites and the stages,** once each on your final tree: ant testFast and ant testSystem (the skill's tests-running.md, \"When to run a whole suite\"), the library track at 86 or more; the count stage and the distance stage as the skill's compiler.md gives them, against climb batch 29's gate (explorations/compile-ladder/climb-batch-29/gate/), 0 and 0 with #crash none as the probe measured. If you edit scala_src/ beyond the patch, P-148's change run of the count stage on your final tree, beside the probe's (PROBE 8. The gate: the base 1m44.733s; the patch 1m43.621s and 1m40.981s), and the skill's second pass.",

A changes what the stages read, so it runs the count stage and the distance stage once on its final tree, against climb batch 29's landed 0 and 0. T edits only Specification/. Whether u = 0 holds for a zero u: NN32 is the curator's question: the probe's state lands, walk's answer pinned in an XXX test. microGPT changes no line, and its quick checks under walk stay 7 of 7.

Make it, and commit it. A test of a defect you find, here or below, goes in the test folder for its kind that the skill\'s tests-writing.md, "Where a test goes, and how it passes", gives, ProjectFortress/tests/ or a compiled one such as ProjectFortress/compiler_tests/, whatever the section\'s list of files says; where that list lacks the folder, the test\'s path goes in pointsReached, as a path outside the section does (below). An assertion or a test you add is seen failing through the harness on the base\'s code, run with the old code tool (the skill\'s worktrees.md, "Running the old code"), and passing on the head: the fix is already in the tree, so the base is where it fails.',
'- A defect of the change: it is wrong, or incomplete, a sibling site its own repair owes, a crash where the text gives an error, a test not seen failing first. Fix it, test first: the program that measured it becomes a gated test or an assertion (the skill\'s tests-writing.md), seen failing through the harness on the worker\'s head before your edit; then the fix, where it belongs and in the library\'s way, after you have listed the ways; built as the skill\'s build-and-caches.md says; the test seen passing; and, when your fixes change Java or Scala of the checker, of walk or of a shared phase, the whole suite they reach once, after your last fix (the skill\'s tests-running.md). Commit each fix with its test in one commit whose title begins "Skeptic\'s fix:", and push. Run no count or distance stage after a fix: the gate\'s tables on the merged tree are the record, and SKEPTIC.md says that the report\'s tables are those of the worker\'s head.',
'- Settled or contested. A fix is settled when the rung\'s section, the specification or a decision on record says that what your fix makes the code do is right: cite that sentence with the fix. A fix is contested when (a) the worker\'s report argues for the behaviour your fix changes, not only for its form; or (b) nothing on record settles it and you chose among ways; or (c) it touches a path the section does not give the rung and no sentence you cite settles it. A fix that reaches a point to report, or touches a path outside the section, is not contested for that alone: when a sentence you cite settles it, it is settled, and the point or the path goes in pointsReached for the curator. Make a contested fix all the same, in a commit of its own, and list it in contested with the worker\'s argument and yours: a judge rules on it alone, and may revert it.',
'- Refuse only when the rung cannot be fixed here: its approach is wrong and a fix would redo it; the fix needs a path no rung of this batch may touch, or a decision of the curator; or it is larger than a repair round. Then make no fix for that finding, and refuse with the one thing that must change.',

Work it out from git diff ' + BASE + '...<branch> per branch before you apply anything, and say in your result what order you chose and why.',
'',

'1. Its net change: git diff ' + BASE + '...<branch> > tmp/gather/<slug>.patch, then git apply --3way --index on it. A hunk that fails in a file another rung also touched is the conflict this stage exists to see: in unrelated regions, resolve it by hand from both sides and say so; where both changed the same logic, do not guess: leave the tree clean, and return with the conflict named. Then its files under explorations/compile-ladder/<slug>/. The branch carries REPORT.md and record.md where the skeptic wrote them from the run\'s journal, and SKEPTIC.md. Where it lacks one, run that file\'s command from textCommands below, from ' + MAIN + ' (the journal tool finds the journal itself), and compose nothing; where the rung had a repair round (repaired true), run the REPORT.md and record.md commands even where the branch carries the files, since the repair round\'s texts replace the worker\'s. A command that exits 1 wrote nothing: report the file missing; so is a SKEPTIC.md whose text is only the word committed.',
'2. Its record, record.md, folded. The FACTS.md entry under the section of its area (the file\'s README gives the rule), after the section\'s last entry: the fact, its source and its test in a few lines. Each change to an existing ledger row: a note that adds a fact with ' + LEDGER + ' note N "TEXT"; a row\'s new line, and any change to what a row says (its claim narrowed, a half fixed, its test promoted or renamed, its notes at the limit), with ' + LEDGER + ' rewrite N FILE, the whole line in a file under tmp/gather/, its claim and notes stating the gap as it stands now and not its repair history. A note the tool refuses for length goes in through rewrite, the row\'s notes cut back to what holds now: none is left out. Each new row: its line, its number cell ?, into a file under tmp/gather/, then ' + LEDGER + ' add FILE --section "TITLE", the section its writer names or the one its class fits; the tool numbers it and checks it against the template, and a row it refuses you correct to the template, keeping its claim.

The handover line in the RECORD.md of the batch, section "Handover lines" (the first section of the old handover file is retired into the first section of PLAN.md, which the coordinator keeps). The rung\'s "Revival change" section is folded into no file: copy it, both its parts word for word, or its line "Revival change: none" with the reason, to tmp/gather/<slug>-revival-change.md for step 7. Write nothing under .claude/: the batch writes no skill text, and the skill writer writes the skill from RECORD.md after the landing. Any file:line a record cites that an earlier rung\'s hunk shifted is re-anchored by symbol.',
'3. The corrections still owed: each leftForGather item of the rung\'s skeptic, below; each sentence of the specification that the rung\'s REPORT.md lists as made false by its change and that the rung did not edit, an Appendix I Effect or a note on walk or the compiled path, corrected to what the code does, each clause checked against the code line it states. Such a sentence states what the code does, so it is not a text mismatch.',

'   A text mismatch is not blocking. Where one rung\'s specification text and another rung\'s code disagree and the decisions on record settle it, fix the side they settle. Where they do not, it is reversible and lands as a point to report: the text stands as the rung wrote it; the path that departs gets a ledger row and a gated XXX test asserting the text\'s rule, or, where no such test can show the departure, as when it shows only in the one library\'s world, a gated test of today\'s behaviour, the row saying why; the text\'s entry in Specification/appendices/changes.tex names that row among its departures; all in the later rung\'s commit, and the mismatch goes in your forCurator.',
'5. One commit: the applied source and tests, the rung\'s REPORT.md, SKEPTIC.md and JUDGE.md if any, a decision record if it has one (record.md is folded, not landed: take it out of the index and the tree once step 2 has folded it), FACTS.md, the ledger and its history file, the handover, and PLAN.md when step 4 wrote to it. Stage them by an explicit list and read git diff --cached --stat before you commit. Title: what the repair does, in plain words; body: the two or three sentences of record.md that say why, and where the commit touches any path outside explorations/ and .claude/, a line beginning "historical:" naming the files of the original 2012 tree it edits, from the provenance block.

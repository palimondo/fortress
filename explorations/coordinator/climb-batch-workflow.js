// Workflow script: one batch of the compile-path ladder climb.
//
// What it does, stage by stage, and why: explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.md
// (the manual) and explorations/coordinator/process-engineering/batch-redesign.md (the
// practice it builds, with the evidence and the cost of each choice). A batch is a manifest
// change and nothing else: the coordinator splices the block between the MANIFEST and END
// MANIFEST lines from the batch's generator (explorations/compile-ladder/plan-<N>/manifest/)
// and launches. Before the launch the coordinator builds the batch's one base build; each
// rung worker makes its own worktree, seeded from it:
//   Workflow({scriptPath: 'explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.js',
//             args: {base: '<the full hash of the base>', baseBuild: '<the base build, a built worktree at that commit>'}})
//
// The shape since the redesign of 2026-10-08: each rung's worker does the rung test first;
// its skeptic checks it and fixes what it finds, test first; a judge rules only on a fix
// the skeptic marks contested or on a rung it cannot fix, and a repair round runs only on
// the judge's word; no second skeptic. Then the gather lands the approved rungs on main,
// the merged-diff review and the gate run side by side, and the commit stage lands the
// gate's tables, runs the microGPT walk check and pushes. The batch writes no skill text:
// each rung's revival-change material goes into the batch's RECORD.md, and the standing
// skill writer writes the skill from it after the landing, before a cold read
// (explorations/reviews/skills-agenda-audit.md, "Proposed fix to the mechanism"). Every
// agent is pinned to Opus but a judge's second ruling on the same rung or tree, which runs
// on Fable (POSITIONS.md, "The judge's rulings."). Every prompt
// points to the fortress-repo skill for how to build, test, run the old code, wait and
// commit, and says only what the role does in this batch. No backticks and no non-ASCII
// character anywhere in this file.
//
// Every agent() call goes through callAgent ("An agent that comes back with nothing"),
// which runs a role again, up to two more times, when its agent returns nothing; a usage
// or rate limit, or a rung worker, skeptic or judge that returns nothing after its
// attempts, stops the run there and decides nothing, and resumeFromRunId with the same
// script and args then runs that role again.

The distance stands at 34 and the count at 30 after climb batch 18 (compile-ladder/climb-batch-18/gate/), the count stage about 68 s at its gate; by the planner's measurement S takes the distance to 31 and the count to 28, and by the P-152 probe's P moves neither. P is a checker rung and follows P-148: the count stage timed once on the base build and once on the correct change, a profile and a second pass that keeps every result, as the skill's compiler.md, \"The checker's time\", gives the steps, and its skeptic times it again. S changes the library and a phase before the checker, and runs both stages without a speed pass. No two rungs change one declaration or share a file, and no rung builds on another. P edits walk's OverloadedFunction.java, the checker's OverloadingOracle.scala and TypeSchemaAnalyzer.scala, overloading.tex and one entry of Appendix I; S edits PreDisambiguationDesugaringVisitor.java and the library's FortressLibrary.fss and FlatString.fsi. ant testSpecData runs in the gate because climb batch 18's landed summary has it."

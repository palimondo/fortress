// Workflow script: one batch of the compile-path ladder climb.
//
// What it does, stage by stage, and why: explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.md
// (the manual) and explorations/coordinator/process-engineering/batch-redesign.md (the
// practice it builds, with the evidence and the cost of each choice). A batch is a manifest
// change and nothing else: the coordinator splices the block between the MANIFEST and END
// MANIFEST lines from the batch's generator (explorations/compile-ladder/plan-<N>/manifest/)
// and launches. Before the launch the coordinator builds the batch's one base build; each
// rung worker makes its own worktree, seeded from it:
//   Workflow({scriptPath: 'explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.js',
//             args: {base: '<the full hash of the base>', baseBuild: '<the base build, a built worktree at that commit>'}})
//
// The shape since the redesign of 2026-10-08: each rung's worker does the rung test first;
// its skeptic checks it and fixes what it finds, test first; a judge rules only on a fix
// the skeptic marks contested or on a rung it cannot fix, and a repair round runs only on
// the judge's word; no second skeptic. Then the gather lands the approved rungs on main,
// the merged-diff review and the gate run side by side, and the commit stage lands the
// gate's tables, runs the microGPT walk check and pushes. The batch writes no skill text:
// each rung's revival-change material goes into the batch's RECORD.md, and the standing
// skill writer writes the skill from it after the landing, before a cold read
// (explorations/reviews/skills-agenda-audit.md, "Proposed fix to the mechanism"). Every
// agent is pinned to Opus but a judge's second ruling on the same rung or tree, which runs
// on Fable (POSITIONS.md, "The judge's rulings."). Every prompt
// points to the fortress-repo skill for how to build, test, run the old code, wait and
// commit, and says only what the role does in this batch. No backticks and no non-ASCII
// character anywhere in this file.
//
// Every agent() call goes through callAgent ("An agent that comes back with nothing"),
// which runs a role again, up to two more times, when its agent returns nothing; a usage
// or rate limit, or a rung worker, skeptic or judge that returns nothing after its
// attempts, stops the run there and decides nothing, and resumeFromRunId with the same
// script and args then runs that role again.

The Fable judgement of the curator's type decisions (explorations/reviews/type-decisions-review/judgement.md, V2 and section 2, item 1) keeps the decision and reads it so: the Index bound finishes the team's wish; the tuple rule makes a tuple type a subtype of a trait type, which the designers' tuple-type text forbids (Specification-1.0-frozen/basic/types-vals-vars.tex:214-215, :265, :272-273; the 2012 Types chapter, types.tick:341, :424), so it is recorded as the revival's departure, and the team asked for a conversion, not a subtype.

"**The answers this rung follows.** P-157, as the curator rewrote it on probe A1's result: Vector and Matrix stay additive groups, and the overloading check's exclusion test reads the self type and the static parameters' bounds, so the arrays' scalar + and - stand beside the vectors' own; with symbolic operators checked (P-155) the checker refused 8 such pairs, though no call fits both: a vector's own + takes two vectors, the block's + an array and a number, and arrays exclude numbers; so the exclusion test reads a self-typed trait's self as C[\\X\\] & X, the fact that P-146's extender rule guarantees, and its existential reduction reads the static parameters' bounds (P-152); specificity and the Return Type Rule keep the plain signatures. P-146: in a self-typed trait the checker types self in the method bodies as C[\\X\\] & X; the method signatures keep the plain trait type, since the POPL 2019 paper's proofs assume that no declared type holds a type parameter inside an intersection; only the overloading check's exclusion test reads self in a signature as C[\\X\\] & X; an extender must be a subtype of the static argument it gives. P-152: walk and the checker read the exclusion of two generic declarations over their whole parameter types, by existential reduction. P-88: the scalar block that microGPT uses stays. P-148: a rung that changes the checker also makes the change fast. F-245: the full check's 8 vector errors. F-225: the self type as built. The probe is explorations/perf-probes/self-type-exclusion/REPORT.md (probe A1), with self-exclusion.patch and bound-exclusion.patch: shadow (i), the self type in the exclusion test only, clears none of the 8 alone; shadow (ii), the bounds in the exclusion test's reduction, clears the four scalar-on-the-left pairs alone; both clear all 8, the full check 191 to 183 with no library line, nothing else gone or come; the count stage under the full check 102 to 98; 52 compiled tests with the same output; no stall. The coordinator's brief takes A1's defaults: shadow (ii) in the exclusion test only, not its global variant; tint stays refused (row 786 CONTESTED); the solver's recursion that a first form of (ii) met is filed now.

Walk's half of conditional extension (row 774) waits. The second run, climb batch 21b, turns the full check on (rung C), aligns the api with its component (rung E) and runs the team demos (rung D), after this run lands. The distance stands at 5 and the count at 3 after climb batch 20 (compile-ladder/climb-batch-20/gate/); with the full check the same library gives 191 (F-245). The full check goes from 191 to 137 with S, to 67 with B and to 183 with X, each measured on the base, and so to 5 for the run together, the figure the planner measured for the run's library text with the vectors' lines of the branch not taken in X's place; the stock stages stay at 5 and 3, and the specification's examples and microGPT's quick pair pass on that text. S's test is the full-check stage, the probe's run-shadow.sh with catch, its before the planner's base table; B has walk tests first, X compiled tests and N walk tests. B and X change the checker and make P-148's speed pass; S and N do not. No two rungs change one declaration, and no rung builds on another; S, B and N edit Library/FortressLibrary.fss, S and B its api, and X the checker's exclusion test only, in files no other rung of this run edits; the gather applies S, B, X, then N. ant testSpecData runs in the gate because climb batch 20's landed summary has it."

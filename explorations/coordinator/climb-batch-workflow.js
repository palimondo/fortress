// Generalised 2026-09-19 from the script that ran climb batch 1, so that the
// next batch is a MANIFEST CHANGE AND NOTHING ELSE: the coordinator replaces the
// block marked "MANIFEST" below and launches. Batch 1's manifest is kept below
// the "END MANIFEST" line as BATCH_1_EXAMPLE, the worked example, which the
// script does not use.
//
// The changes this revision carries are the six process decisions Pavol took on
// 2026-09-19 (POSITIONS.md, "after climb batch 1 landed"), as
// explorations/coordinator/process-decisions-review-1.md amended them, plus the
// eight free changes of repair-batch-review.md section 10. What each stage does
// now and which review item each change answers is written up in
// explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.md.
//
// Launch, after the worktrees exist (remote-container.md, "Setting up a batch's
// worktrees"):
//   Workflow({scriptPath: 'explorations/coordinator/climb-batch-workflow.js',
//             args: {base: '<the commit main is at>'}})

"**What it changes, by decided rule.** (a) The four bodies LSHIFT/RSHIFT on ZZ64 and ZZ32 (LibraryBuiltin/CompilerBuiltin.fss:643-644 and :732-733, today self << other and self >> other over the masking natives simpleLongArith.java:322-336 and simpleIntArith.java:337-351) take the smart-shift rule: a count at or beyond the width gives 0 for a left shift and the replicated sign bit for a right shift; in range, the machine shift, bits shifted out falling off; a negative count shifts the other way by its magnitude, saturating the same way, with the most negative count handled before any negation. Whether the rule lives in new natives beside the masking ones (bound in the import blocks at CompilerBuiltin.fss:25-74 and :155-196) or in the Fortress bodies over << and >>, the rung argues in one line; either way the machine word is shifted and nothing goes through ZZ, and <<, >> and <<< do not change. (c) The six guards at simpleIntArith.java:80, :85, :90 and simpleLongArith.java:89, :94, :99 test a == Integer.MIN_VALUE (resp. Long.MIN_VALUE) instead of a==(-a), which is also true of zero. (d) NN64.narrow (CompilerBuiltin.fss:875) goes from jLongOverflowingToUnsignedInt to jLongWrappingToUnsignedInt, imported at :94 and used nowhere, and the signed sibling ZZ64.narrow (:655) from jLongOverflowingToInt to jLongWrappingToInt, imported at :51; the getter asZZ32 (:577) is another spelling and keeps its throw.",
"",
"**The gated assertions it reverses.** Rung W's assertions of the throw, library_tests/IntConversionsRungW.fss:61-63 (ZZ64 narrow of 2^32, MAX and MIN overflow) and :81-82 (NN64 narrow of 2^64-1 and 2^63 overflow), become the low-32-bit answers 0, -1, 0 and 4294967295, 0. This is the only place in the batch where a rung changes what a gated test asserts, and it is Pavol's decision, not the rung's; the shouldOverflow helpers there go if nothing else uses them, and nothing else in that file changes. No declaration goes into the compiler prelude (coordinator/library-route-judgement.md, step 0), so the spec's shift is declared only in the one library, by rung I; the compiled ZZ's <<< (CompilerBuiltin.fss:547, over BigInteger.shiftLeft) already computes it.",

"**The test, first.** ProjectFortress/compiler_tests/IntSemanticsRungB.fss + .test in the form of compiler_tests/AtomicTopLevelVar.test (tests=IntSemanticsRungB, link, run, run_out_contains=PASS, run_out_does_not_contain=FAIL): the shared table below, on ZZ32 and on ZZ64; |0|, -0 and 0 DIV -1 answering 0 on both widths; |MIN|, -MIN and MIN DIV -1 still throwing IntegerOverflow on both, caught as rung-integral-ops/probes/AbsZero.fss catches it. Operands are typed variables, never bare numerals, and the minimum is written -max - 1, as library_tests/Integer3.fss:49-50 and IntegralOpsRungN.fss:214 do, because a numeral of bit length 32 or 64 takes another slot or the string-carried path (FACTS.md, the two literal-wrap lines); ZZ64 results are compared through asString, for the reason IntegralOpsRungN.fss:197-198 gives.

"**The siblings, which wait on a rider.** The same a==(-a) test, and its twin b==(-b), sits in eight more methods of the same two files, ten guards in all, and four of the methods are reachable from the prelude: longOverflowingMul (simpleLongArith.java:70-85), behind ZZ64's DOT, CROSS and juxtaposition (CompilerBuiltin.fss:591, :593, :626) and behind REM (:597), which multiplies by the quotient, so behind MOD, GCD and LCM too; longSaturatingMul (:248-261, DOTCROSS at :595); and intSaturatingNeg/longSaturatingNeg (simpleIntArith.java:278-281, simpleLongArith.java:269-272, unary DOTMINUS at :669 and :584). The saturating Div and Abs on both widths are imported and used by no body. Measured on the landed tree while this record was prepared, compiled: on ZZ64, 0 DOT 5, 5 DOT 0, 0 5, 3 REM 5, 3 MOD 5, 3 GCD 5, 12 GCD 18 and 12 LCM 18 all throw IntegerOverflow, where walk gives 0, 0, 0 and the ordinary answers; DOTMINUS 0 is 9223372036854775807 on ZZ64 and 2147483647 on ZZ32; 0 DOTCROSS 5 on ZZ64 is -9223372036854775808. IntegralOpsRungN.fss passes only because none of its ZZ64 operands makes a zero factor or a zero quotient. Without the rider, the rung repairs none of them and gives them home 2 of the shared prefix: compiler_tests/XXXIntZeroSiblings.fss + .test asserting the specification's answers above (the XXX prefix is honoured for .test files at FileTests.java:932), and the ledger row. With the rider, the rung applies the same rule to all ten guards and the assertions go into IntSemanticsRungB.fss (home 1), with one trap: once the multiply tests only the minimum, a zero factor falls through to Long.MAX_VALUE / Math.abs(a) (simpleLongArith.java:82, and :258 in the saturating twin) and divides by zero, so zero needs its own line, or the method becomes Math.multiplyExact, which is Java 8 and the JVM's own spelling of exactly this check.",

Ladder: nothing declared. Among the 85 files of baseline-2026-09-19/pass-list.txt only tests/chain0.fss names GCD or LCM (:33-38, small positive ZZ32 operands) and none names LSHIFT, RSHIFT, narrow, shift, DOTMINUS or DOTCROSS; every other answer this rung changes was a throw, which no passing file reaches, so a move is an UP and the batch's result. Checker count: 103 declared and unchanged, because the stage reads the checker and Library/ and this rung touches neither. writesState is false: the natives are pure functions. The rung stops rather than widens if a fix would add or change a declaration in the compiler prelude, or change an assertion of a gated test other than rung W's five.",

A negative count now shifts the other way by its magnitude, saturating at the width the same way (to 0 for a right shift of an unsigned or non-negative value, to -1 for a negative signed one), with Long.MIN_VALUE as a count handled before any negation.

A negative count beyond the int range now gives the exact 0 or -1; a positive one on a nonzero value has no result the JVM's BigInteger can hold, so it fails loudly instead of wrapping, the rung choosing and recording which exception (when the JVM precludes it, Pavol's principle is not to fight it); zero shifted stays zero.

It is declared in trait ZZ of Library/FortressLibrary.fsi (:537-544) with its body in the component's trait ZZ (Library/FortressLibrary.fss:825 onward, beside LSHIFT at :881-884). The count takes LSHIFT's AnyIntegral unless the rung argues another: the spec's IndexInt names no type in the library. One trap, measured: a ZZ-typed binding of a ZZ32 value dispatches LSHIFT to the ZZ32 native (y: ZZ = x with x: ZZ32 = 3 gives y LSHIFT 33 = 0), so the body converts to the unbounded integer first (big, .fsi:534, declared on ZZ64 and inherited by ZZ32; NN64 has none, and the rung finds its route), and shift(3, 33) is 25769803776 on a ZZ32 receiver. The name is new at top level; the library's other shift is the array-origin dotted method (.fsi:1293, :1316, :1336, :1416, :1446), and a collision with it is a stop.",

'## Four rules every batch enforces',
'',
'1. "Where does this fix belong" is a required step, answered before any edit. Use spec-to-implementation.md and modules-and-phases.md. Rung 7 is the case in point: it wrote a run-time implementation without finding that INTEGERLITERALFOLDING is already wired before TYPECHECK (compiler/phases/PhaseOrder.java:57,142), and without engaging the team\'s comment three lines below the block it cited: "Do not enable these until coercion is implemented; doing so will cause all our arithmetic to occur on IntLiterals" (LibraryBuiltin/FortressBuiltin.fss:483-485).',
'',
'2. Precedent search before writing code. Ask "has the team solved this here already, and in how many ways", and answer it by citation. Rung 3 is the case in point: the right shape existed twice in VarCodeGen.java and the wrong shape once, and it copied the wrong one. And a precedent that repaired a defect is evidence the same defect is elsewhere in that file: count the sites and give the number. The repair batch\'s refusal was exactly this - the brief had named rung 0\'s guard and said not to redo it, and 22 unguarded sites in the same two files were the refusal.',
'',
'3. The specification\'s prose chapters are the standard; the api renderings are not. Specification/library/structure.tex:25-31 says Part Library "is largely automatically generated from the API code for the libraries themselves", so citing Specification/library/apis/*.tex to justify an edit to the matching .fsi is circular, and two rung reports did exactly that. Cite Specification/basic/ and Specification/basic-lib/. Cite the passage, not the grep hit: read at least ten lines either side of every line you cite before you cite it. The repair batch\'s only two unopened citations came from a grep piped through head, and the sentence that settled the question (basic-integers.tex:569) was one line below the citation and contained none of the grep\'s words.',
'',
'4. The interpreter is evidence, not an oracle. The static type checker runs only on the compile path and walk turns it off, so the interpreter accepts programs the language does not and reports what would be type errors as run-time dispatch failures; 55 ledger rows record its own defects. When walk and the compiled run disagree, that is a question and the specification answers it. Three real outcomes: the specification settles it against the compiled run, so repair; it settles it against the interpreter, so the compiled side may be right and a ledger row is owed against the interpreter; or the specification is silent. A silent specification is NOT a reason to stop - it is the reason to think harder: review the architecture around the construct, derive the candidate behaviours with what each costs and what else it touches, decide holistically which is right for the language, execute that one, and write the reasoning down. (The batch record names the stops that apply to every rung of this batch, on top of the standing ones: a change to a declared type the prelude already has, and a renamed or removed declaration a gated test uses.)',
'',
'A fourth case exists and is legitimate: the specification settles the divergence but the repair lies outside this rung\'s scope. Then the rung lands and opens a verified ledger row naming the defect, the specification clause, the probes both ways, the location of the fix and what the fix is. That is what rungs 6 and 7 did with row 317 and it was right.',
'',
'## What a measured defect is worth: the three homes',
'',
'This batch closes the gap the last three campaigns left - 22 defects measured by skeptics, 2 of them gated. Every defect anyone in this rung measures has exactly one of three homes, and the record says which and why:',
'',
'1. **Measured by anyone and repaired in this rung** - by the worker in its own first pass, by the skeptic, or in a repair round: it gets an ASSERTION in the rung\'s own gated test, and that assertion exists and passes BEFORE the second skeptic runs. Not a FACTS line, not a probe: an assertion. The cheapest form is an extra assert in the .fss file the rung already added; a new file is only needed when the defect is in another area. The assert message string carries the citation - the ledger row number or the specification line - and nothing else does: no provenance comment in the source (see "What you write" below).',
'',
'2. **Deferred, and the specification settles it** - the rung does not repair it, but the specification says what the answer is: it gets a gated EXPECTED-FAILURE test, whose file name starts with XXX. The harness makes this a real check, not a wish. FileTests.java:922 sets shouldFail = s.startsWith("XXX") from the file name; :577 and :644 make (shouldFail != failed) the failure condition, so an XXX test that STARTS PASSING turns the suite red, and :841 says the suite prints "XXX tests that succeed". So write XXX<Name>.fss asserting what the SPECIFICATION says, with a .test file beside it; it fails today, which is expected, and the day anyone repairs the defect without closing the ledger row the gate says so. 224 XXX*.test files in compiler_tests/ already use this. One caveat, from the harness\'s own author at FileTests.java:843 - "WARNING: expect_failure is not treated consistently" - so the first XXX file a rung adds is shown to go red on a deliberate local fix, and the report says it was shown.',
'',
'3. **Deferred, and the specification is silent** - a probe file with its captured output, named .txt, committed under probes/, and a ledger row that cites it. This is the only home that is not a gated test, and the record says explicitly that it is here because the specification is silent, not because it was easier.',
